# Artificial Neural Network
## Components
### 1. Biometric Dataset
### 2. Neural Network based on numpy in python

## Features
#### 1. SGD used with cross-entropy cost function to prevent tapering at saturation
#### 2. Accuracy of around 96% achieved.
#### 3. Large weight initializer for better initialization of parameters
#### 4. regularization parameter available.

## Scope for Improvement
#### 1. use theano or other gpu supported library for faster computation
#### 2. softmax with log likelyhood cost maybe a good option for training
#### 3. hyper-parameters can be optimized and overfitting be prevented by using validation set.
